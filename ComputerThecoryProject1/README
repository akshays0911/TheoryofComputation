CSCI 561 --- Project 1

The purpose of this project is to learn about:

1. Algorithms for regular language manipulation,

2. The application of regular languages to the control of discrete
   event systems.


INSTRUCTIONS
============

1. Form groups of 3-4 to work on this project.

2. Complete the following functions in project-1.lisp:
   1. REGEX->NFA
   2. NFA->DFA
   3. DFA-INTERSECTION
   4. DFA-MINIMIZE

3. Answer the questions in project-1-report.pdf.

4. Submit two files: the lisp code and the PDF report.  Include all
   group names in the submitted files (only one group member needs to
   submit).


EXTRA CREDIT
============

For extra credit, you may implement the following functions:

1. FA-COMPLEMENT
2. FA-EQUIVALENT
3. FA-SUBSETEQ

Grading
=======

Your code will be run for grading using (approximately) the following
procedure:

    sbcl --load project-0.lisp --load testcases.lisp

Your code needs to produce the correct result to receive credit for
each test case. Make sure your code loads cleanly without compilation
errors, extra I/O, or other side effects.

"Correct" for REGEX->NFA, NFA->DFA, and DFA-INTERSECTION means that
the language defined by the returned finite automaton is equivalent
and, for NFA->DFA, that the result is a DFA.  "Correct" for
DFA-MINIMIZE means that the language defined by the returned DFA is
equivalent and the state is minimized.
