CSCI 561 --- Project 0

The purpose of the project is to familiarize you with functional
programming and the Common Lisp development environment.

Please take the time to setup the lisp development environment
(explained below). IF YOU DO NOT SETUP A REASONABLE DEVELOPMENT
ENVIRONMENT, THE OTHER COURSE PROJECTS WILL BE /EXTREMELY/ DIFFICULT.

INSTRUCTIONS
============

1. Form groups of 2-4 to work on this project.

2. Complete the function stubs in project-0.lisp.

   Use only the following standard Lisp functions, macros, operators,
   and constants in your definitions, along with any previously
   completed functions in this project:

    - T
    - NIL
    - IF
    - WHEN
    - COND
    - NOT
    - AND
    - OR
    - EQUAL
    - CONS
    - LIST
    - CAR
    - CDR
    - FIRST
    - SECOND
    - THIRD
    - DEFUN
    - LABELS
    - LET
    - LET*
    - FUNCALL
    - QUOTE

3. Answer the questions in project-0-report.pdf

4. Submit two files via Canvas (only one submission needed per group):
   a. Your source code (project-0.lisp)
   b. Your report answers (project-0-report.pdf)

LISP ENVIRONMENT SETUP
======================

I strongly recommend that you use SBCL (http://sbcl.org/) and
Emacs/SLIME (https://common-lisp.net/project/slime/) on Linux.

If you are not using Linux as the host operating system on your
computer, we provide a virtual machine (VM) image that you may use.
Instructions: https://github.com/ndantam/mines-cs-vm

SBCL Setup
----------
SBCL (Steel Bank Common Lisp) is high performance Common Lisp system.

On Debian/Ubuntu:

    sudo apt-get install sbcl

Other platforms: http://sbcl.org/platform-table.html

Quicklisp/SLIME
---------------

Quicklisp is a lisp package manager.

SLIME is the Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs.

    wget https://beta.quicklisp.org/quicklisp.lisp
    sbcl --load quicklisp.lisp \
         --eval '(quicklisp-quickstart:install)' \
         --eval '(ql:add-to-init-file)' \
         --eval '(ql:quickload "quicklisp-slime-helper")' \
         --eval '(quit)'

The above call to SBCL will print several commands at the end to add
to your ~/.emacs file.  Add these commands to your ~/.emacs file.

Alternative 1: SLIMV
--------------------

Slimv is a SWANK client for Vim.  It is an option, but students in the
past have reported that SLIME works better.

Alternative 2: LispWorks IDE
----------------------------

LispWorks is a commercial Lisp system.  Their "Personal Edition" is
available gratis (no charge) for educational use.  It may work for
you, but SLIME will probably work better.
